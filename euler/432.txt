Total choosing 4 points from 9 is 126

There are 8 ways to have three in a line. Each case there can be 6 triangles.
8*6 = 48

126 - 48 = 79

But Euler says there are 94. Am I over counting 15?


Another way

4 Big Middle Triangles  =     4
4 Middle midel          =     4
4 reverse middle        =     4
8 little sides          =     8
4 Corners               =    12-4
8 Trucated corners      =     8

                             --
                             26
